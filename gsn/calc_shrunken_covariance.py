    mn, c, shrinklevels, nll = calc_shrunken_covariance(data,leaveout,shrinklevels,wantfull)

    <data> is a matrix with dimensions observations x variables.
    There can be more variables than observations. In addition, the 
    dimensions of <data> can be observations x variables x cases (where
    the number of cases at least 2); in this special scenario,  
    we perform handling of "mean-subtraction" for each case
    (see details below).
    <leaveout> (optional) is N >= 2 which means leave out 1/N of the data for
    cross-validation purposes. The selection of data points is random.
    Default: 5.
    <shrinklevels> (optional) is a non-empty vector (1 x F) of shrinkage fractions
    (between 0 and 1 inclusive) to evaluate. For example, 0.8 means to
    shrink values to 80  of their original size. Default: np.linspace(0,1,51).
    <wantfull> (optional) is whether to use the identified optimal shrinkage
    fraction to re-estimate the mean and covariance using the full dataset
    (i.e. including the initially left-out data). Default: 0.

    Using (N-1)/N of the data (randomly selected), calculate a covariance 
    matrix and shrink the off-diagonal elements to 0 according to
    <shrinklevels>. (The diagonal elements are left untouched.) The shrinkage
    level that maximizes the likelihood (i.e., minimizes the negative log 
    likelihood) of the left-out 1/N of the data is chosen. If <wantfull>,
    we re-estimate the mean and covariance using all of the data and the
    identified shrinkage level. If not <wantfull>, we just return the 
    shrunken estimate from (N-1)/N of the data.

    Note that we try to detect pathological cases in the case of multiple
    <shrinklevels>, and if detected, we will issue warning messages.

    The case where <data> has multiple cases along the third dimension
    is useful for when you have multiple sets of measurements, each of
    which has an unknown mean. In this scenario, we calculate the covariance
    of each case separately (thereby ignoring the mean of each sample)
    and then average (pool) covariance estimates across cases.
    Note that in this special scenario, we perform cross-validation on 
    cases (not observations), the returned <mn> is necessarily all zero,
    and the left-out data are also mean-subtracted before evaluating the
    cross-validated likelihood of covariance estimates.

    Return:
    <mn> as 1 x variables with the estimated mean
    <c> as variables x variables with the estimated covariance matrix
    <shrinklevel> as the shrinkage fraction that was chosen
    <nll> as 1 x F with the mean negative log likelihood on the left-out data.
     one or more values can be NaN (e.g. singular covariance matrices).

    for n in [90, 1000]: #  number of observations
        sigma = 0.5*np.ones((numvar,numvar));
        np.fill_diagonal(sigma, 1)
        x = np.random.multivariate_normal(np.ones((numvar,)),sigma,numvar)
        xcov = np.cov(x);
