%% Example 1: Using GSN to estimate signal and noise

% GSN is a method that estimates signal and noise distributions that
% underlie neural response measurements.
% 
% The purpose of this Example 1 is to guide the user through basic calls 
% to GSN, using a representative, small-scale test dataset. The goal is 
% to show the full process of calling GSN, inspecting noise ceiling (ncsnr) 
% values, visualizing signal and noise covariance matrices, and performing PCA.
%
% Users encountering bugs, unexpected outputs, or other issues regarding 
% GSN shouldn't hesitate to raise an issue on GitHub:
% https://github.com/cvnlab/GSN/issues
% 
% The example data have dimensionality 100 voxels x 200 conditions x 3 trials. 
% The data are from an fMRI experiment measuring responses to auditory
% sentences. The values reflect fMRI response amplitudes in percent BOLD
% signal change units. The voxels are taken from a 
% brain region in the left hemisphere. 

%% PREPARE AND DOWNLOAD THE DATA

% Start fresh

close all

this_dir    = fileparts(which('example1.m'));

% Add path to GSN
run(fullfile(this_dir, '..', '..', 'setup.m'));

% Download files to data directory
input_dir = fullfile(this_dir, 'data');
if ~exist(input_dir, 'dir')

%% APPLY GSN TO THE DATA

% Load data
a1 = load(input_file)
%%

% a1.data contains 100 voxels x 200 conditions x 3 trials.
% The values are fMRI response amplitudes in percent signal change units.

% Perform GSN.
% We explicitly set the wantshrinkage flag to 1 (true).
results = performgsn(a1.data,struct('wantshrinkage',1))
%%

% We have several outputs in results:
% mnN is the mean of the noise distribution
% cN is the raw estimate of the covariance of the noise distribution 
% cNb is the final estimate of the covariance of the noise distribution
% mnS is the mean of the signal distribution
% cS is the raw estimate of the covariance of the signal distribution 
% cSb is the final estimate of the covariance of the signal distribution
% shrinklevelN is the shrinkage fraction used when estimating the noise distribution
% shrinklevelD is the shrinkage fraction used when estimating the data distribution
% ncsnr is the noise ceiling snr for each voxel (signal sd divided by noise sd)

% Notice that the noise covariance estimate involved some shrinkage:
results.shrinklevelN
%%

% Notice that the data covariance estimate involved some shrinkage:
results.shrinklevelD
%%

%% VISUALIZE THE RESULTS

% Let's take a look at ncsnr
figure;
hist(results.ncsnr);
xlabel('Noise ceiling SNR');
ylabel('Frequency');
%%

% Things look good as there are plenty of voxels with positive ncsnr.
% Some ncsnr values are 0. This indicates that these voxels apparently
% do not seem to have any signal.

% Let's visualize the covariance estimates
rng = [-.5 .5];
figure; 
  % this is the noise covariance estimate
subplot(2,2,1); imagesc(results.cN,rng); axis image tight; colormap(parula); title('cN');
  % this is the final noise covariance estimate
subplot(2,2,2); imagesc(results.cNb,rng); axis image tight; colormap(parula); title('cNb');
  % this is the signal covariance estimate
subplot(2,2,3); imagesc(results.cS,rng); axis image tight; colormap(parula); title('cS');
  % this is the final signal covariance estimate
subplot(2,2,4); imagesc(results.cSb,rng); axis image tight; colormap(parula); title('cSb');
%%

% Notice that the diagonals of the noise covariance are stronger than the diagonals 
% of the signal covariance. This means the noise is larger in magnitude than the
% signal. This is consistent with our earlier look at ncsnr.
%
% Also, notice final covariance estimates (cNb and cSb) look similar to 
% the raw covariance estimates (cN and cS).

% However, there are some differences:
corr(results.cN(:),results.cNb(:))
%%
corr(results.cS(:),results.cSb(:))
%%

%% PERFORM PCA
 
% Define a function to compute effective dimensionality
edfun = @(x) sum(x)^2/sum(x.^2);

% For the estimated signal covariance and the estimated noise covariance,
% convert to correlation units and then compute eigenspectra and eigenvectors.
[uS,sS,vS] = svd(convertcovariancetocorrelation(results.cSb),0);
[uN,sN,vN] = svd(convertcovariancetocorrelation(results.cNb),0);

% Note that svd can be performed on the original covariance (as opposed to
% the correlation version). The results will be different, and reflect a 
% different interpretation. By converting to correlation, we are giving
% each voxel equal influence in the signal correlation matrix and in the 
% noise correlation matrix, even though there may be variations in the 
% signal and noise variances associated with different voxels in the 
% original (non-normalized) data.

% Visualize the eigenspectra
figure;
subplot(1,2,1); hold on;
h = [];
h(1) = plot(diag(sS),'r-');
h(2) = plot(diag(sN),'k-');
title(sprintf('Signal ED = %.1f, Noise ED = %.1f',edfun(diag(sS)),edfun(diag(sN))));
legend(h,{'Signal' 'Noise'});
xlabel('Dimension');
ylabel('Eigenvalue');
subplot(1,2,2); hold on;
plot(cumsum(diag(sS))/sum(diag(sS))*100,'r-');
plot(cumsum(diag(sN))/sum(diag(sN))*100,'k-');
xlabel('Dimension');
ylabel('Cumulative variance explained (%)');
%%

% Notice that the noise has higher dimensionality than the signal.
